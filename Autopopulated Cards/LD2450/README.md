# LD2450 Dashboard Card
This yaml code will look into the integration entities of the ESPHOME and grab all the LD2450 entities that use the name pattern given in the [yaml](https://github.com/uncle-yura/esphome-ld2450/blob/master/example_ld2450.yaml) from [@uncle_yura](https://github.com/uncle-yura/esphome-ld2450)s template and represent the coordinates of the targets tracked and the zones used, on a ploty card.
No need to enter entity - device names.
